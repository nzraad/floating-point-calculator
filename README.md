## What is Vercel?

Vercel is a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database. We provide a frictionless developer experience to take care of the hard things: deploying instantly, scaling automatically, and serving personalized content around the globe. We make it easy for frontend teams to develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences, where performance is the default.

## Vercel UI Featutes

Vercel tries to automatically detect the frontend framework you’re using for your project and configure the project settings for you. If Vercel detects a framework, the Build Command will automatically be configured. Depending on a framework, the Build Command can refer to the project’s configuration file. After building a project, most frameworks will output the result in a directory. Contents in this output directory will be the only things that will be statically served by Vercel.

## Vercel Backend / Functions / API Features

With Vercel, you can deploy Serverless Functions, which are pieces of code written with backend languages that take an HTTP request and provide a response. You can use Serverless Functions to handle user authentication, form submission, database queries, custom slack commands, and more. To deploy Serverless Functions without any additional configuration, you can put files with extensions matching supported languages and exported functions in the /api directory at your project's root.

## CI / CD

Using Vercel for GitHub, it automatically deploys your GitHub projects with Vercel, providing Preview Deployment URLs, and automatic Custom Domain updates. Vercel for GitHub will deploy every push by default. This includes pushes and pull requests made to branches. This allows those working within the repository to preview changes made before they are pushed to production. With each new push, if Vercel is already building a previous commit, the current build will be canceled to build the most recent commit so that you always have the latest changes deployed as quickly as possible.
